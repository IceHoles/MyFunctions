Completely reformed version of gauss-jordan elimination

Now rows and columns full of zeroes aren't getting removed

The quantity of variables matches with result vectors

Each result vector has an 1 in row, corresponding to its number of variable of result matrix

It didn't passed my test with two columns filled only with zeroes (idk how to fix this currently)
